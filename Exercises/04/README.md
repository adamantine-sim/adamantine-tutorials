Set the material property
=========================
The goal of this exercise is to set the material properties necessary to run a
simulation. You will set the material properties for three phases: solid, liquid, 
and powder. In order to do this, you will need to modify the `input.info` file.
You can run the exercise using `./adamantine -i input.info`. The solution of 
the exercises is given in `solution.info`.

Please refer to the documentation in the
[materials](https://adamantine-sim.github.io/adamantine/doc/input_file.html#materials-required)
section.
