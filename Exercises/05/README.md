Run ensemble simulation
=======================
The goal of this exercise is to run an ensemble of multiple simulations. You
will need to set the number of simulations in the ensemble and set the standard
deviation of a chosen quantity. In order to do this, you will need to modify the 
`input.info` file. You can run the exercise using `./adamantine -i input.info`. 
The solution of the exercises is given in `solution.info`.

Please refer to the documentation in the
[ensemble](https://adamantine-sim.github.io/adamantine/doc/input_file.html#ensemble-optional)
section.
