Create a mesh
=============
The goal of this exercise is to create a mesh using adamantine's own mesh
generator. In order to do this, you will need to modify the `input.info` file.
You can run the exercise using `./adamantine -i input.info`. The solution of 
the exercises is given in `solution.info`. 

Please refer to the documentation in the
[geometry](https://adamantine-sim.github.io/adamantine/doc/input_file.html#geometry-required) 
section.

Load a mesh
===========
Instead of creating a mesh, adamantine can also load a mesh. You can try loading
the provided mesh `domain.msh`.
